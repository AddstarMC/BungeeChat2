# Here you define channels. Each channel should be given a name and a listenPermission
# <name>:
#   listenPermission: '<permission>' # optional
# 
# If listenPermission is omitted, then anyone will be able to listen to this channel
#
# channels can also be given a command(s) and permission for that command so players can
# talk in them.
# <name>:
#   scope: <scope> # optional
#   listenPermission: '<permission>' # optional
#   format: '<format>' # required
#   command: '<command>' OR command: ['<command>','<alias>',...] # required
#   commandPermission: '<permission>' # optional
#   highlight: <true|false> # optional
#
# scope is an optional value which defines the range of this channel. Values are:
# - GLOBAL - default, channel broadcasts everywhere on the network
# - SERVER - channel broadcasts everywhere on the server
# - WORLD - channel broadcasts only in the originating world
# 
# format is the format string for creating the output for display. More info above
# command is either the name of the command, or a list of commands that will be used to 
#   talk in this channel. Commands should not add the leading slash.

#   will be the same as the listenPermission. if listenPermission is also omitted, then
#   everyone will be able to run the command
